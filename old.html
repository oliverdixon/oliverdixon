            Oliver Dixon: WWW Instance</h2>

        <p>I am an undergraduate student, associated with the Department of
        Mathematics and the Department of Computer Science. My interests
        principally lie in the subdisciplines of Automated Theorem-Proving, and,
        more broadly, Compiler Theory. I am also interested in the Philosophy of
        Mathematics, paying special attention to Set Theory and some elements of
        Real Analysis. I was once associated with the Department of Electronic
        Engineering; this is no longer the case.</p>

        <p>Here are some books and third-party on-line resources that I have
        found helpful, from the perspective of an undergraduate with little
        mathematical background. Sophisticated readers will probably benefit
        from denser texts, however the additional oft-extraneous commentary
        offered by some authors provides a very comfortable introduction to
        ``proof-based'' mathematics, which is in stark contrast to most (all?)
        A-level programmes. I will expand this list as I continue to find
        helpful resources, likely in the direction of 20th Century Pure
        Mathematics. (I am currently reading Lang's <i>Algebra</i> and Mac
        Lane's <i>Categories for the Working Mathematician</i>, but I do not
        feel like they would be a good fit for this list!) I compiled the
        majority of this list before coming to University or receiving any
        formal teaching; as such, I generally deem these resources as
        appropriate for self-study. Most of the books are available in
        <a href="//yorsearch.york.ac.uk/">The Library</a>.</p>

        <p><b>*</b> There are large portions of this book that I dislike, but
        the original philosophy of <i><a href="//www.axler.net/DwD.html">
                Down with Determinants</a></i> is excellent for elementary LA.

            wonderful YouTube lecture series about Abstract Linear Algebra</a>,
        complete with a plethora of examples and counter-examples pertaining to
        the various algebraic structures. MIT OpenCourseWare has also made
        available a full Linear Algebra course (18.06), complete with 
        <a href="//ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/pages/resource-index/">

        <p>Vocationally, I am interested in systems programming, including
        embedded and real-time systems work; I once calculated that I have spent
        more time writing C and ARM than I have being married, although that's
        probably no longer true (I discovered Complex Analysis...). Readers of
        my <i>Programming Support Session</i> scripts can attest to my
        <del>pedagogical impairments</del> programmatical superiority.</p>

        <p>I maintain a passing hobby in electronic typesetting (particularly
        for aesthetically intransigent mathematical expressions). I strongly
        believe that TeX and its various deranged offspring are antiquated and
        in dire need of replacement with a modern, modular, and programmable
        solution that can be encoded into generalisable AST-like data structures
        which lend well to translation-based static analysis. Absolute
        separation of code and data is easily achievable with modern theory, so
        why did the evolution of typesetting halt in the 70s?</p>

        <p>My University e-mail address should be clear from the URL of this
        page. Members of the University can access more information about me via
        the old York Directory, since the new one doesn't work properly. This
        index page hides a colossal amount of resources (gigabytes) that have
        accumulated over the years. If I mentioned that something is
        ``available on my website'', but you cannot find it, please e-mail or
        telephone me. The structure itself is a web of soft symlinks that is
        subject to change, so I would advise against crawling under this
        directory! Cheers.</p>
