I am an undergraduate student at the University of York, currently reading the
Computer Systems (Computer Science) MEng programme.

I have been programming for a while, and my contributions exist in many (likely
disjoint) corners of the web under differing e-mail addresses and public keys,
but I intend to place most future work in repositories on this GitHub account.
For the longest time, my language-of-choice was C, but I am now moving over to
Haskell and Java to follow my research interests without the various burdens of
a language designed for the PDP-11. Professionally, I use (and thoroughly enjoy)
modern C++.

If you would like to contact me, please use [my University e-mail
address](mailto:od641@york.ac.uk).
