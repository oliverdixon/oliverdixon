I am an undergraduate student at the University of York, currently reading the
Computer Systems (Computer Science) MEng programme. I am principally interested
in Theoretical Computer Science, particularly Category Theory with
[applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01259) to lambda calculus and
generalised functional paradigms. Recently I have been developing interests in
parsers, compilers, and optimisation, and I also maintain a (substantial) hobby
of studying disparate areas of Pure Mathematics from [Homotopy Type
Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11082) to [Non-Standard
Analysis](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NonstandardAnalysis.html).

I have been programming for a while, and my contributions exist in many (likely
disjoint) corners of the web under differing e-mail addresses and public keys,
but I intend to place most future work in repositories on this GitHub account.
For the longest time, my language-of-choice was C, but I am now moving over to
Haskell and Java to follow my research interests without the various burdens of
a language designed for the PDP-11.

If you would like to contact me, please use [my University e-mail
address](mailto:od641@york.ac.uk). I also maintain [a collection of GitHub
Gists](https://gist.github.com/oliverdixon), some of which may be occasionally
useful.

(La)TeX is a mess. I'm going to rewrite it one day.
