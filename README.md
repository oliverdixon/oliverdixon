I am a Mathematics undergraduate student at The University of York; I am
principally interested in Analysis, particularly of the nonstandard variety, and
Category Theory with applications to lambda calculus and generalised functional
paradigms. The latter provides a perfect intersection between the pure sciences
and computing, and most recently I have been developing interests in parsers,
compilers, and optimisation.

I have been programming for a while, and my contributions exist in many (likely
disjoint) corners of the web under differing e-mail addresses and public keys,
but I intend to place most future work in repositories on this GitHub account.
For the longest time, my language-of-choice was C, but I am now moving over to
Haskell and Java to follow my research interests without the various burdens of
a language designed for the PDP-11.

If you would like to contact me, please use
